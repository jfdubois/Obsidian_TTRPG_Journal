# Introduction

This personal project was created to help me take structured notes for my TTRPG campaign and to share it with anyone who may find it useful.

The first version focuses on creating **player-facing campaigns**, but I am currently working on adding a **DM role** and related features.

# Credits

Most of this project is based on an existing system built by _Nicole van der Hoeven_ and adapted to my needs.

# General Idea

This system uses **frontmatter properties** to build relationships between entities (note types) and to organize them across various location layers.

A central **`world.md`** note is used to manage the campaign during creation. It allows you to:

- Create entities
    
- Generate session notes
    
- View all campaign entities in one place
    

Entity creation is handled through a **dynamic form**, streamlining the process and reducing typos. This makes it easier to link entities to their locations—whether they belong to planes, regions, towns, or even sewers.

Session note creation is automated. Each session note provides:

- A recap of the previous session
    
- A logbook section
    
- A combat-tracking structure
